Absolutely 😎 — adding small design elements like *****, -----, and borders will make your ATM project look neat and professional (and teachers love it!).

Here are some ready-made design ideas you can sprinkle throughout your program 👇

🌟 Header Designs
print("\n" + "*" * 40)
print("        SMART ATM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM        ")
print("*" * 40)


or a cleaner style:

print("\n" + "=" * 45)
print("💳  WELCOME TO SMART ATM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  💳")
print("=" * 45)

🔹 Section Dividers

Use these between functions or before a new section:

print("\n" + "-" * 40)
print("         ADMIN LOGIN SECTION")
print("-" * 40)


or:

print("\n" + "~" * 50)
print("            USER TRANSACTION MENU")
print("~" * 50)

💫 Success / Error Messages
print("\n" + "*" * 30)
print("✅ Transaction Successful!")
print("*" * 30)

print("\n" + "!" * 30)
print("⚠️ Invalid PIN or Account Number")
print("!" * 30)

🪩 Exit / Thank You Message
print("\n" + "=" * 40)
print("💰 Thank You for Using Smart ATM 💰")
print("=" * 40)

💡 Pro Tip

Use consistent symbols across your whole project — for example:

* → Titles or highlights

- → Menus

~ → Section dividers

= → Start/End of program

If you want, I can insert these stylish designs directly into your ATM code layout, so the final program looks presentation-ready (perfect for printing).
Would you like me to do that?
